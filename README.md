# Java Server Faces WS Client

This is a tiny example about how to consume a webservice using Faces.

* ManagedBean calls WS service
* WS gets an avaiable job list from a Government service
* The response is converted into a valid Java entity
* The list is rendered at a Primefaces' dataTable component.
